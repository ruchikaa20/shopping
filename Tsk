Task Name: Mobile-Friendly - Effective Communication Techniques on Different Platforms

Over the past few weeks, I compared Microsoft Teams and Slack to understand their effectiveness in team collaboration and communication.

Microsoft Teams integrates seamlessly with Office 365, making it ideal for document collaboration, video meetings, and scheduled calls. For instance, while working with a Retail Giant, we used Teams to co-edit Excel sheets and conduct weekly check-ins via video calls, which streamlined reporting and decision-making.

On the other hand, Slack is more informal and ideal for real-time messaging. It supports app integrations like Google Drive, Trello, and Zoom. While supporting a Pharma Company, we used Slack channels to manage project updates, and huddles for quick audio chats, which helped reduce meeting overload.

Best Practices:

Keep communication channels topic-specific to reduce clutter.

Use mentions (@name) to notify the right team members.

Maintain professionalism in tone.

Set clear agendas for calls and follow up with summaries.

Use status updates to reflect availability.


Both platforms promote productivity, but the choice depends on project needs and team structure.
