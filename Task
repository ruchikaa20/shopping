1. Automated Customer Support (Chatbots and Virtual Assistants)
Purpose: Use Generative AI to handle routine customer inquiries via chat or voice.
Benefits: Reduces customer service costs, offers 24/7 support, and improves response time. It also personalizes the customer experience using past data.
Challenges: Ensuring data privacy and maintaining accuracy in understanding complex queries. Regulatory compliance is also a concern.

2. Fraud Detection and Reporting Assistance
Purpose: Use Generative AI to analyze transactions and generate detailed suspicious activity reports (SARs).
Benefits: Enhances efficiency in compliance departments, detects fraud patterns quicker, and reduces manual reporting efforts.
Challenges: AI must be trained on high-quality, balanced datasets. Over-reliance could lead to missed or false alerts. Continuous monitoring and updates are necessary.

Note: These applications are generalized and can apply to a Global Bank implementing GenAI to improve operations and compliance.
